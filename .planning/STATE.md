## Initialization Summary

- PROJECT.md created — 2026-03-24
- Config: mode=yolo, granularity=standard, parallel=true, research=true, plan_check=true, verifier=true
- Research complete: stack, features, architecture, pitfalls, SUMMARY.md
- REQUIREMENTS.md created — research-refined with implementation notes
- ROADMAP.md created — 7 phases, 11/11 requirement sections covered

## Key Decisions Logged

- Use `postgres.js` direct Neon connection (not `neon-http`, not PgBouncer)
- Clerk satellite domains required for `{subdomain}.ploutizo.app` — must be Phase 1
- `tenantGuard()` checks `!orgId` (falsy), not `orgId === null`
- Budget rollover capped at 1× base limit
- TFSA withdrawals: disclaimer only in v1
- Negative settlement: display as green credit
- `postgres.js` initialized at module scope in `@ploutizo/db` with `DATABASE_URL` (no VITE_ prefix); `@ploutizo/db` is api-only (never imported by apps/web)

## Blockers / Open Items

- TFSA 2026 annual limit — verify against CRA before Phase 6
- RRSP 2026 dollar cap — verify against CRA before Phase 6
- Bank CSV real exports — collect before Phase 5 (LOW confidence on column names)
- Neon connection limit on chosen plan — verify before Phase 1 goes live
- ReUI Tailwind v4 compatibility — verify DataGrid/Filters before Phase 3
- Cloudflare proxy for `clerk.ploutizo.app` — must be "DNS only" (grey cloud)
